# Develop / Contribute

## Environment

Run `setup-env.sh` to setup an development environment. This mainly consists of a python3 virtual env
containing [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and updating the git sub-modules for `bats-core`.

## Testing

We are using [bats-core](https://bats-core.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for bash unit testing.

To execute the tests, run:

```shell
./run-tests.sh
```
